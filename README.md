# GitHub Action for substituting variables in parameterized files ![.github/workflows/ci.yml](https://github.com/microsoft/variable-substitution/workflows/.github/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg?branch=master)

With the Variable Substitution Action for GitHub, you can apply variable substitution to XML, JSON and YAML based configuration and parameter files.

-	Tokens defined in the target configuration files are updated and then replaced with variable values.
-	Variable substitution is applied for only the JSON keys predefined in the object hierarchy. It does not create new keys.
-	Only variables defined explicitly as Environment variables as part of the workflow or system variables that are already available for workflow context can be used in substitution. 

If you are looking for more Github Actions to deploy code or a customized image into an Azure Webapp or a Kubernetes service, consider using [Azure Actions](https://github.com/Azure/actions).

The definition of this Github Action is in [action.yml](https://github.com/microsoft/variable-substitution/blob/master/action.yml).

# End-to-End Sample Workflow

## Sample workflow to apply Variable substitution on XML, JSON, YML files

```yaml
# .github/workflows/var-substitution.yml
on: [push]
name: variable substitution in json, xml, and yml files

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: windows-latest
    steps:
    - uses: microsoft/variable-substitution@latest
      with:
        files: 'Application/*.json, Application/*.yaml, ./Application/SampleWebApplication/We*.config'
      env:
        Var1: "value1"
        Var2.key1: "value2"
        SECRET: ${{ secrets.SOME_SECRET }}

 ```
Define `splitChar` to change the character used to split the environment variable names for variable identification and substitution
 ```yaml
# .github/workflows/var-substitution.yml
on: [push]
name: variable substitution in json, xml, and yml files

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: windows-latest
    steps:
    - uses: microsoft/variable-substitution@latest
      with:
        files: 'Application/*.json, Application/*.yaml, ./Application/SampleWebApplication/We*.config'
        splitChar: '__'
      env:
        Var1: "value1"
        Var2__key1: "value2"
        Var3__key1__key2: "value3"
        SECRET: ${{ secrets.SOME_SECRET }}

 ```
